1. delete extraneous extraction fields (for emphases and not majors) from course_codes.txt (and save changes to github)
Deiva: 1-91, Mythri: 92-182, Nathan: 183-273, Rishit: 274-364
3. improve formatting so each course code has its own line
4. use the full text file to find the prerequisites for each course code
5. (if possible) start a database with major, required courses & prerequisites for each one
