1. delete extraneous extraction fields (for emphases and not majors) from course_codes.txt (and save changes to github)
2. improve formatting so each course code has its own line
3. use the full text file to find the prerequisites for each course code
4. (if possible) start a database with major, required courses & prerequisites for each one
